/**
  * Represents the environment that provides stimulus to the input neurons in ```simulation``` time.
  *
  * This environment class is a basic implementation that accepts a sequence of input neurons to which
  * it periodically sends signals through a provided signal function. At each period, calls the provided
  * signal function, handing it the input neurons and the current time. The signal function returns a
  * `map(neuron â†’ signal)`, and for each neuron in the map, this class sends the specified signal.
  *
  * This class sends signals after an initial delay, periodically, for the specified duration. At the end of
  * the duration, calls the specified clean-up function.
  *
  * This basic environment actor can be used to to digitize signals by treating the `period` as the digitization
  * sampling period. Note however, that there is a lower limit of a few to 10 ms to that `period` and that there
  * will be noise associated with the akka schedule that schedules the repeated calls.
  *
  * @param neurons      The neurons to which to send the signal
  * @param clock        The signal clock for the simulation that holds the current simulation time and time-factor
  *                     that defines how many seconds in real-time are 1 second in simulation time.
  * @param initialDelay The initial delay before sending a signal (in real time)
  * @param period       The delay between periodic signals (in real time)
  * @param duration     The duration for which to send signals (in real time)
